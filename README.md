DocuGuard is a powerful command-line utility designed for content monitoring and compliance within digital environments. This tool integrates the capabilities of Unix's grep and find utilities, providing a robust solution for scanning files across a system to detect specified keywords. DocuGuard is particularly useful in settings requiring adherence to content guidelines and policies, such as educational institutions, corporate environments, and social media platforms.

Introduction

DocuGuard is a specialized tool developed to assist in the automated monitoring of text files for specific keywords that may indicate a breach of predefined content policies. By leveraging advanced searching techniques, DocuGuard efficiently identifies potential policy violations, making it an essential tool for maintaining content integrity and compliance.
Features

    Keyword Search: Users can specify one or more keywords to search within files, supporting both case-sensitive and case-insensitive searches.

    Flexible Search Directories: Searches can be performed within the current working directory or a specified subdirectory.

    Output Customization: Search results can be displayed on the screen or redirected to a specified file for further analysis.

    Verbose Mode: For detailed debugging or development purposes, DocuGuard can output verbose logs that include every file and directory accessed during the search process.

    Help and Usage Instructions: The utility includes a help option that provides users with detailed command usage instructions.

Usage

To utilize DocuGuard, users should structure their commands with options that tailor the search process to their specific needs. Below is the basic command structure:

sniff [options] "search keywords"

Options:

    -h, --help: Display help information.

    -v, --verbose: Enable verbose output.

    -o <file>, --output=<file>: Redirect output to a specified file.

    -d <path>, --dir=<path>: Specify the starting directory for the search.

    -i, --ignore-case: Perform a case-insensitive search.

Example Command:

sniff --verbose -o results.txt --dir ~/Documents "confidential"

This command will search for the keyword "confidential" starting in the ~/Documents directory, with verbose output saved to results.txt.
